# Overview
This C++ project is an extensive implementation of an Object-Oriented Program simulating an assembly line. It showcases the ability to apply advanced C++ concepts and techniques in a real-world scenario. The project is designed to simulate an assembly line with various stations, each equipped with specific stock items, managed by a line manager who oversees the movement and processing of customer orders through the line.

Features
Dynamic Assembly Line Simulation: Simulates an assembly line with a customizable number of stations.
Station Specific Stock Items: Each station has its unique set of stock items for processing orders.
Order Processing: A line manager moves customer orders through the line, filling them based on item availability at each station.
Comprehensive Tracking: Tracks the progress of orders, identifying completed and incomplete orders based on inventory levels.
Project Structure: The project is organized into three major milestones, each focusing on different aspects of the simulation:

Milestone 1: Utilities and Station Classes
Utilities Module: Facilitates parsing input files for setting up the assembly line.
Station Module: Manages information about each assembly line station.

Milestone 2: CustomerOrder Module
Focuses on processing customer orders along the assembly line, ensuring efficient handling of each order.

Milestone 3: Workstation and LineManager Modules
Workstation Module: Represents an active station on the assembly line.
LineManager Module: Manages the overall assembly line configuration and order flow.

Installation and Usage - To run this project, clone the repository, and compile the source files using a C++ compiler. Detailed instructions for running and testing each module are provided in the respective milestone directories.

Testing
The project includes a tester module and input files for validating each part of the simulation.
Ensure to test each module individually before integrating them into the complete simulation.
